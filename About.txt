Python program to find the factorial of a number using function, loop, and if-else conditions:

The above program defines a function named factorial that takes a number as input and returns the factorial of that number.

The function first checks if the input number is negative or zero, in which case it returns appropriate error messages.

If the input number is positive, the function initializes the factorial variable to 1 and then iterates through the range from 1 to the input number. For each number in the range, the factorial variable is multiplied by that number. Finally, the function returns the factorial of the input number.

The program then tests the function by calling it with the input 5, and prints the result, which is 120, the factorial of 5.
